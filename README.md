# kata-solutions

This repository has solutions to some of the lengthier kata I have done at codewars.  Most of these are not meant to be completely refactored.  With some, I was in way over my head and was just fortunate to power my way to an answer (e.g. miner).  

I may revisit and refactor at a later time.

This repository is for posterity and potential employers to view, but I want to be clear that these are not meant to be examples of professional code, but rather an expression of my problem solving skills.
